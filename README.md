## 1: Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose:
The aims of the project are:
- Creating an online store of a clothing store called Quixoteque (this store is assumed to be real).
- To enable customers to shop by by choosing the products they want with or without having an account on website.
- Ensuring that the store owner can effectively perform features such as adding a new product, updating the existing product etc.
### 1.2 Scope:
Today, many stores have online shopping websites. In this way, customers can easily buy the products they want by choosing them online, without going to the store. In this project, it is planned to create a useful and functional website for a clothing store called Quixeteque so that users and store owners can use it easily and effectively, as in other applications. 

From this point of view, it is possible to divide the project into two parts. The front side of the website will be designed in a simple way and HTML, CSS, JavaScript and ReactJS or a different framework will be used when necessary. The backend side of the site is planned to be built on Apache Server and database operations are planned to be done with PostgreSQL. The technologies mentioned here are within the current plan and may change according to the course of the project.

### 1.5 Overview:
The project document is divided into some sections to make it easier to understand. Each chapter provides a detailed description of the project. In order to see the version control of the document more clearly, it is aimed to open the project on GitHub and follow it from here. In this way, the update dates can be observed in the first part of the document.
## 2: Positioning
### 2.1 Business opportunity:
Since the online shopping site to be built already has a real store, it is expected that the store will have its own customer group. From this point of view, the majority of customers who currently prefer the store will also prefer to shop on the website. In addition, the store can gain more customers with opportunities such as special discounts for online shopping. As a result, with online shopping, people will reach the product they want more easily and effectively, thus a different income source will arise for the store.
### 2.2 Problem statement:
The project will focus on solutions to the following requirements:
- A user-friendly online shopping site should be created.
- Anyone with or without an account on the website should be able to access it.
- Users should be able sign up the site and edit their personal information.
- Users should be able to add and remove the product they want to their shopping card.
- A separate interface should be created for the store owner that only he can access
- The store owner should be able to add and remove the products to the website.
### 2.3 Product position statement: 
## 3: Stakeholder and user descriptions
### 3.1 Market demographics:
Since the planned online shopping website already has a real store, it is expected that the website will have a certain customer group from the first day. These customers will be people who love the brand and follow the products of this brand. But as the popularity of the website and the brand increases, it can be said that it will attract the attention of many people who want to buy clothes. Because of these, the user group of the website will consist of people from almost all ages (except children) who want to buy clothes.
